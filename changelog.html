				<h4>You are currently using Version 3.1.1 of my website!</h4>
				<h4>This website was completely developed in HTML and CSS and all of the source code can be found at github.com/tornowcodes/tornow1500.cc</h4>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Changelog:</h3>
			<ul> 
			<li> Version 0.1 â€¢ The original website with the hot pink and comic sansðŸ’€ </li>
			<br>
			<li> Version 1.0.1 â€¢ The version of my website that doesn't make people cringe by looking at it, introducing a new colour pallete, font choice and links </li>
			<br>
			<li> Version 2.0: This version has an entirely new colour pallete, introducing a nice blue shaded look, a 404 error page, the About Me(In the source code, the file for this page is called "aboutthismac.html") AND the easter egg, which includes something I don't exactly want people knowing. Especially the people at my school. It can be accessed by tornow1500.cc/index/yourguess (Fill "yourguess" in with what you think the extension leading to the easter egg is) </li>	
			<br>
			<li> Version 3.0 â€¢ This version brings a major design and colour change. Introduces the Devices and Changelogs sites, basically decenterallizing the "About Me" tab on Version 2.0. Credit to CtrliPhones for helping out with most of the work. He is the main reason that this version eliminates most of the ChatGPT code. The easter egg is now a one word guess, and I have added my dad's old website(failed attempt at a forum) as an easter egg as well. </li>
			<br>
			<li> Version 3.0.1 â€¢ This version brings minor bug fixes, such as making sure that the links don't turn purple when clicked on. Also, the easter egg(s) can now be accessed via tornow1500.cc/yourguess without the unnessasary preamble. Thought I should mark that more clearly, as the link structure has had a major overhaul in 3.0(as well as the rest of the site) Also, my fathers website has been better preserved, accessible via tornow1500.cc/eatmeout(A slightly dirty ring of "punchmeout.ca", which my dad will be cancelling soon)</li>
			<br>
			<li> Version 3.1 â€¢ This version adds links to my Patreon and TikTok in the nav bar. I also fixed a glitch with the secret easter egg where the Changelog section wasn't showing(but I don't think that really matters because no one will find it, I hope)</li>
			<br>
			<li> Version 3.1.1 â€¢ This version aligns the Changelog and Devices text to the left of the page. I also added my 11th grade religion culminating as an extension. Accessible at tornow1500.cc/worldreligionscrapbook. A website was one of the options so that's what I did, because I couldn't think of a better way to flex to my teacher that I HAVE A WEBSITE!!! (Weird flex I knowðŸ’€). Use the contents as you please, they're all open source and I don't care if you copy my homework. Hell, I'll also include the sources/citations in the source code at github.com/tornowcodes/tornow1500.cc. Just promise to not make it too obvious if you actually submit this. Also, if this website somehow makes SEO (Search Engine Optimization), then I don't know what to tell you unfortunatly.</p>
