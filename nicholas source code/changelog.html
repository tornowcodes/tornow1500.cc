				<h4>You are on Version 3.0 of my website!</h4>

				<h3>Changelog:</h3>
			<ul> 
			<li> Version 0.1 â€¢ The original website with the hot pink and comic sansðŸ’€ </li>
			<br>
			<li> Version 1.0.1 â€¢ The version of my website that doesn't make people cringe by looking at it, introducing a new colour pallete, font choice and links </li>
			<br>
			<li> Version 2.0: This version has an entirely new colour pallete, introducing a nice blue shaded look, a 404 error page, the About Me(In the source code, the file for this page is called "aboutthismac.html") AND the easter egg, which includes something I don't exactly want people knowing. Especially the people at my school. It can be accessed by tornow1500.cc/index/yourguess (Fill "yourguess" in with what you think the extension leading to the easter egg is) </li>	
			<br>
			<li> Version 3.0 â€¢ This version brings a major design and colour change. Introduces the Devices and Changelogs sites, basically decenterallizing the "About Me" tab on Version 2.0. Credit to CtrliPhones for helping out with most of the work. He is the main reason that this version eliminates most of the ChatGPT code. The easter egg is now a one word guess, and I have added my dad's old website(failed attempt at a forum) as an easter egg as well. </li>
